# The art of negotiation: Six must-have strategies

## influence and persuasion

How do your actions and relationships frame your ability to impact, influence and persuade? Gillian Ku, Professor of Organisational Behaviour, shares six interpersonal principles of how we interact with people that affect oneâ€™s ability to influence and persuade others.

### Reciprocity

We try to repay in kind what another person has provided us.

An overpowering rule that enforce the uninvited debts.

Examples/Use

- free gift
- survey with 25 dollar if return VS 5 dollar whatever
- reciprocal concession in negotiations.

Defuse

- reject gift
- accept but wary, even redefine a relationship
- excuse for *let me think about your offer*
- organizational limits

### Commitments and Consistency

Once we make a choice, we will encounter personal or interpersonal pressures to behave consistently.

Commitments are most effective when they are active, public, effortful and viewed as uncoerced. 

Examples/Use

- Petitions
- foot in door technique

Defuse

- ignore sunk costs
- neutral party check judgement
- avoid public commitments unless you are certain

### Social Proof

The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more we will perceive the idea to be correct.

We use others actions to decide on proper behaviors for ourselves when uncertainty reign and others are similar to us.

Examples/Use

- laugh tracks
- auctions, merges and acquisitions

Defuse

- understand your motivations for doing something, don't just follows the crowd

### Liking

We prefer to say yes to the requests of people we know and like.

We tend to like people who are

- physical attractive
- similar to us
- familiar
- compliment us
- associated with positive things

### Authority

We tend to defer to (obey) authorities in a mindless fashion.

Tendency to respond to mere symbolic authority, e.g. titles, uniforms, trappings.

### Scarcity

We tend to assign more value to opportunities when they are less available.

Scarcity is particularly potent where things are newly scarce and when we compete with others for them.

Limited numbers and time limits.

Examples/Use

- buy now
- auction fever, competition, scarcity and time pressure
- open house

Defuse

- beware an adrenalin rush
- understands your motivations
