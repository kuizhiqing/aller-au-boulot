## Neural Network Approximation

Ronald DeVore, 2020

Abstract.

* NNs used for learning algorithm
* solving high dimensional partial differential equations
* popularity and empirical success on computer chess/go, autonomous navigation, face recognition
* theoretical explanation are lacking
* answer: the ability of NNs to produce accurate function approximation
* traditional approximation: polynomials, wavelets, rational function, splines
* comparison: rate distortion (i.e. error versus the number of parameters used to create the approximant)
* computational time, stability of the approximation algorithm

Result.

* NNs with ReLU activation function
* output piecewise linear fucntion, convex polytopes
* increased ability to approximation at the expense of numerical stability

Introduction.

* Universal function approximation IS NOT ENOUGH
