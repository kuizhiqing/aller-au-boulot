# Jax

JAX has 4 main function transformations 

* `grad()` to automatically differentiate a function

* `vmap()` to automatically vectorize operations

* `pmap()` for parallel computation of SPMD programs

* `jit()` to transform a function into a JIT-compiled version

These transformations are (mostly) composable, very powerful, and have the potential to expedite your programs several times over.
